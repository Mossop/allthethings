# AllTheThings

Why should you have to visit a whole bunch of different places to see everything that you have on your plate right now? Why can't you just see All The Things?

Part task list, part notes, part file storage, part dashboard this app attempts to pull together everything you need to keep track of in one handy place.

Within the app you can create items that can be notes, files, simple links, or something provided by one of the plugins. Items can be checked off (depending on the type), archived or snoozed for a later time.

Need some organisation? You can create a hierarchy of projects to separate out the different things you're working on. Each project can also be separated out into a set of sections. And for good measure you can create entirely different contexts to switch between to separate your work projects from your home projects.

## Plugins

A set of plugins allows you to pull items from elsewhere. Think GitHub issues, Emails, anything really. When a plugin finds something new it is added to the Inbox where they can be moved to any of your projects.

Currently supported plugins:

* Bugzilla
* Google (Gmail and Docs)
* Phabricator
